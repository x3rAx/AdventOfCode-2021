#%% Part 2

# For the "axygen generator rating", keep all values, that have, from the left
# position on, the same value as the mos common value of that position in all
# lines. This effectively means, find the number, that is numerivally closest
# to `gammaRate`.
# Same goes for "CO2 scrubber rating" and `epsilonRate` but instead for the
# least common value.
#
# ATTENTION: There is a catch:
# With the algorithm described on AoC, it is possible that among the remaining
# numbers, an equal amount of ones and zeroes for a given position can occure,
# in which case the numbers with `1` should be kept. This destroys the
# "closest to" idea from above ðŸ˜¿
